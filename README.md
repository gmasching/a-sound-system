FFMPEG changes too fast.

This used to be able to use FFMPEG to decode sound files and play them. However, FFMPEG tutorials suck and maintaining bindings to internal functions of FFMPEG [since FFMPEG is used as CLI program] is tedious and an ever-moving target. Therefore this project is abandoned, although I worked quite hard on it when it used to work.
